tmux is an open-source terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems. It allows multiple terminal sessions to be accessed simultaneously in a single window. It is useful for running more than one command-line programs at the same time.

The global tmux config is stored in: `/etc/tmux.conf`

```/etc/tmux.conf nums
